title: Add a Provider
---

If you want to add a missing provider, this page describes the required steps and the process behind it.
Listing a provider requires preliminary work.
To make this efficient, the following actions are suggested:

1. Are you the server operator?
If not, please reach out to the operators first.
You will need their collaboration to receive a good rating.

2. Please thoroughly check the [conditions for adding providers](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conditions-for-adding-providers).

3. If you already have questions, please read our [FAQ](/faq/).
If something is still unclear, feel free to [reach out to us](/contact/).

4. Create and host a *provider file*.
The [provider file generator](/provider-file-generator/) helps you with that.

5. To be listed in a specific [category](/faq/#in-which-categories-can-providers-be) such as A or B, your service needs to fulfill certain [criteria](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers#criteria).
Therefore, you may need to add information to your provider file or change your server configuration.

7. Only if you have done the previous steps, [create an issue](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#providers) to be added.

If you are interested in the project's goals and the need for such criteria, you can read the [about page](/about/) and a related [blog post](/blog/2025-07-20-rising-tide-lifts-all-boats/#perspective).

We are looking forward to listing your service!
