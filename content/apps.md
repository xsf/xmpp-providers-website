This website offers a curated list of XMPP providers.
Users can choose one and register on it by using their web browsers.
But some XMPP apps went a step further and integrated this list in their registration process.

Here you can find all known apps with XMPP Providers support.
If they do not fit your needs, there is also an [overview of all available XMPP apps](https://xmpp.org/software).
