title: Add provider
---

If you want to add a missing provider this page describes the required seven steps and the process behind it.
Listing a provider requires pre-work on both sides and to make this efficient we suggestion the following actions:

1. Are you the official server maintainer?
If not, please reach out to the maintainers first.
You will need their collaboration to receive a good rating.

2. Please thoroughly read our [Contribution Guidelines](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md?ref_type=heads#providers).

3. If you already have questions, please read our [FAQ](/faq).
If something is still unclear you can reach out via the [contact page](/contact).

4. Create and host a so-called XMPP Provider File.
You can read more about this and use the [Provider File Generator](/provider-file-generator).

5. To be listed in e.g. [Category A](faq/#in-which-categories-can-providers-be), your server needs to fulfill certain criteria.
Therefore, you may need to add information or change certain properties in the server configuration.
You can inspect the requirements in our [category criteria table](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers#criteria).

7. Only if you have checked and fulfilled the previous steps: Create an issue according to the [Contribution Guidelines](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md?ref_type=heads#providers).

If you are interested to better understand the intentions behind the project and need for such criteria you can read the [About page](/about) and in this [blog post](/blog/2025-07-20-rising-tide-lifts-all-boats/#perspective).

Looking forward to list your service.
