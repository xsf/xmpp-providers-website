title: Your European Union XMPP Chat Provider!

You can now easily find an XMPP provider based in the European Union (EU)!
We have updated our filter options.
Previously, you could filter for the server location of an XMPP provider.
That filter now allows to select EU-only hosted services.

Try it out!
Click the *Filter list* drop-down menu on the [main page](/).

There are many other properties you can filter for, too.
In addition, there is an [overview table](/overview/) of providers with column filters and sorting options.

## Use the Service and Improve XMPP

For a good user experience, [apps integrating XMPP Providers](/apps/) are as important as the [providers](/overview/) themselves.
If you are an XMPP developer, please consider [adding XMPP Providers support](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers#usage) to your app.
If you are an operator of a public XMPP service, provide the [information XMPP Providers needs](/faq/#where-do-we-have-the-providers-properties-from) and [add your service to the list](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#providers).

You can also consider to run your own XMPP server and become a public provider.
With our automated [XMPP server setup](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers-server), you can operate a fully-featured XMPP server with minimal effort.

Feel free to [reach out to us](/contact/) if you have any questions!
