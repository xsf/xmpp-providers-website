With the XMPP Providers project you can now easily find an European Union (EU) based chat provider in the XMPP eco-system!

We have updated our filter options where you can not just filter for the location of a server provider, it also allows to select EU-only hosted services.

Try it out now with the 'Filter list' drop-down menu on [providers.xmpp.net/](https://providers.xmpp.net/).

There are many other service parameters you can filter for, too.
To see the entire table of services with column filter and sorting options you can go to the [XMPP Providers Overview](https://providers.xmpp.net/overview/).

## Use the Service and Improve XMPP

For a good user experience, [apps integrating XMPP Providers](/apps/) are as important as the [providers](/overview/) themselves.
If you are an XMPP developer, please consider [adding XMPP Providers support](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers#usage) to your app.
If you are an operator of a public XMPP service, provide the [information XMPP Providers needs](/faq/#where-do-we-have-the-providers-properties-from) and [add your service to the list](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers/-/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#providers).
You can also consider to run our easily configurable and automated [XMPP Providers Server setup](https://invent.kde.org/melvo/xmpp-providers-server) yourself.
